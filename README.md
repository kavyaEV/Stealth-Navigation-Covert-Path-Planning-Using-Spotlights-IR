# Stealth-Navigation-Covert-Path-Planning-Using-Spotlights-IR
This project implements a “stealth robot” that uses Q-learning to navigate from a given location to another on a known map while avoiding detection by “searchlights”. We outline the algorithms and framework used in our covert path planning implementation as well as our experiments and their results
